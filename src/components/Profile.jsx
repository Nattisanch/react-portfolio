            <article>
                I'm a Data analyst apprentice with a strong passion for learning and creating. I’ve taught myself JavaScript and Python, earned my PCEP certification, and completed programs in cybersecurity and web development.
                My experience as a Data Analyst Intern gave me valuable insight into working with data, problem-solving, and building practical solutions. I enjoy exploring new programming languages and technologies, and I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and make an impact through code.
