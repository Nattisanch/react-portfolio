🚀 About the Project

This portfolio was created to highlight the projects and skills I’ve developed throughout my journey in web development.
During my experience with LiftOff, I learned the foundations of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
After mastering those fundamentals, I advanced to using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
