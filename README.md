🌟 React Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my work, skills, and experience as a web developer. It’s built using React!

🚀 About the Project
This portfolio was created to highlight the projects and skills I’ve developed throughout my web development journey. During my time with LiftOff, I built a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
From there, I advanced into React learning how to structure applications using components, manage state, and build dynamic user interfaces. I also explored Vite, a powerful build tool that made my React workflow faster and more efficient ⚡.
To deploy my portfolio, I learned how to use Vercel by carefully reading the documentation and doing extensive research. This hands-on experience gave me valuable insight into deployment processes, build optimization, and modern hosting practices.
